Release v0-5-1
==============

mtop
----

Added new vars and stats screens.  The stats screen updates until a key
is pressed.  The vars screen shows the page and returns to the main screen.

Moved some of the common key handling routines into functions.

Reduced the amount of space statistics numbers take by only showing
2-4 significant digits.

Added mysqld memory usage for localhost in main header.  Currently uses 
/proc fs and only works for root or mysql user because either the pidfile 
may not have permissive permissions or the proc directory may not.

Release v0-4-1
==============

Makefile.PL
-----------

revision 1.8
date: 2002/02/18 05:04:53;  author: mdprewitt;
Ensure that PREFIX is used for install location instead of
SITEPREFIX.

revision 1.7
date: 2002/02/03 15:50:28;  author: mdprewitt;
Added AUTHOR/ABSTRACT definitions.  Added define to be able to track
Makefile.PL's version number in the generated Makefile.

mtop
----

revision 1.38
date: 2002/02/03 05:10:24;  author: mdprewitt;
Added documentation for the filter commands.
Uncombined the --filter-user command from the --user command.
--user looks for an equality, the filter command uses a regex.

revision 1.37
date: 2002/02/02 15:37:08;  author: mdprewitt;  
Added options to filter with regex by host/db/command/state/info

revision 1.36
date: 2002/01/27 17:07:53;  author: mdprewitt;  
Added info about broken ansi mode in win2k telnet.

revision 1.35
date: 2002/01/24 13:45:56;  author: mdprewitt;  
Fixed explanation of cache hit on help page.  It was showing the incorrect
variable name.

revision 1.34
date: 2002/01/24 03:49:13;  author: mdprewitt;  
Added documentation on how to grant permissions to the mysqltop user.

Release v0-3-1
==============

mtop
----

revision 1.33
date: 2002/01/16 22:26:25;  author: mdprewitt;  
Experimental feature to restrict by host.  The feature will remain but
the implementation may change.  Currently, the host in the process list
is a fqdn but shown as a name without the domain.  The current
implementation prompts for the name assuming it's a short name and checks
to see if the processlist host starts with the user entered host.

revision 1.32
date: 2002/01/15 12:59:56;  author: mdprewitt; 
Removed setpriority since it was degrading interactive performance and not
helping much.  Since mtop is mainly sleeping for keyboard activity, it
doesn't take too much cpu time.

Added a banner at the end of the process list to show the end of the
list.

Release v0-2-1
==============

mtop
----

Added --help option.

Added --version to only show version info.

Added --manualrefresh/interactive keyboard 'm' to prompt for screen refresh.

Override CORE::die to stop curses if it's running so that fatal error messages
can be seen.

Fixed header uptime display.

Screen refresh wasn't refreshing.  Added initial screen refresh and
refresh even if getch returns ERR which it seems to be doing if no
char is waiting in the buffer.

Thanks to Johan Ekenberg for the uptime patch, for noticing the
refresh problem and suggesting the --manualrefresh option.

Added q to 'more'

Added flush command

Fixed message clearing in between messages

Fixed errmsg (should be errstr)

Protect process display from newlines and squeeze multiple spaces.

Changed to get version number from make process.

Cleaned up screen before exiting.

Makefile.PL
-----------

Added --prefix option to allow relocation of binary without modifying
the distribution.

Changed default install prefix location to /usr/local/ (mtop will
install in /usr/local/bin).
