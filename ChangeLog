Release v0-2-1
==============

mtop
----

Added --help option.

Added --version to only show version info.

Added --manualrefresh/interactive keyboard 'm' to prompt for screen refresh.

Override CORE::die to stop curses if it's running so that fatal error messages
can be seen.

Fixed header uptime display.

Screen refresh wasn't refreshing.  Added initial screen refresh and
refresh even if getch returns ERR which it seems to be doing if no
char is waiting in the buffer.

Thanks to Johan Ekenberg for the uptime patch, for noticing the
refresh problem and suggesting the --manualrefresh option.

Added q to 'more'

Added flush command

Fixed message clearing in between messages

Fixed errmsg (should be errstr)

Protect process display from newlines and squeeze multiple spaces.

Changed to get version number from make process.

Cleaned up screen before exiting.

Makefile.PL
-----------

Added --prefix option to allow relocation of binary without modifying
the distribution.

Changed default install prefix location to /usr/local/ (mtop will
install in /usr/local/bin).
